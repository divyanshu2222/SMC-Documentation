                <h2>Module 1: The Law of Supply and Demand</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Any chart is a sequence of supply and demand zones.</li>
                    <li>If you want to become a smart money trader, you first need to learn the law of Supply and
                        Demand.</li>
                    <li>According to Wyckoff Theory, supply and demand determines the price direction:</li>
                    <ol>
                        <li>If demand is greater than supply, the price will rise.</li>
                        <li>If supply is greater than demand, the price will go down.</li>
                        <li>If supply and demand are in balance, there’s no significant price change.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <li>This is one of the most basic principles of all financial markets.</li>
                    <li>There are 2 types of market participants: Aggressive and Passive.</li>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Aggressive Participants:</strong> They use “at market” orders. They have urgency to
                            enter
                            and attack the best
                            price possible. The real engine of the market since they are the ones that initiate the
                            transactions.
                            i.e., An aggressive participation of traders will produce a change in price.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Passive Participants:</strong> They use limit orders. The interaction between
                            aggressive buyers, aggressive
                            sellers, passive buyers and passive sellers is what moves the price. i.e., Passive orders
                            have the ability
                            to stop a move, but not the ability to make the price move. .</li>
                    </ol>
                </ul>
                <h3>Upward Price Movement</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>For the price to move upwards, buyers must buy all supply orders available at that level and
                        continue buying aggressively to force the price up, to find new sellers to trade with.</li>
                    <li>Passive buy orders can slow downward movement but cannot push prices up on their own.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Downward Price Movement</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>For the price to move downward, sellers must consume all demand orders at that level and
                        continue pushing down, forcing the price to go in search of buyers at lower levels.</li>
                    <li>Passive sell orders can slow upward movement but cannot drive prices down alone.</li>
                </ul>
                <div class="note">
                    <strong>Very Important:</strong> Price movement requires aggressiveness. Lack of supply helps prices
                    rise; lack of demand causes them to fall.
                </div>
                <div class="note">
                    <strong>Note:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>In a rising market, as long as buying consumes liquidity (supply) at higher levels, price
                            will rise.
                        </li>
                        <li>In a declining market, as long as selling consumes liquidity (demand) at lower levels, price
                            will fall.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <div class="steps">
                    <h3>Three-Step Process (Market Turn):</h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Exhaustion:</strong> Buyers lose interest in continuing to buy.</li>
                        <li><strong>Absorption:</strong> Smart money places more sell orders; many Passive sellers
                            appear.</li>
                        <li><strong>Initiative:</strong> More and more Aggressive sellers are entering the market.</li>

                    <li>If you want to improve your trading performance and trade along with the big players, implement
                        supply and demand concepts in your strategy.</li>
                    <li>Identify areas where smart money has placed their orders to benefit from their influence.</li>
                    <li>A supply zone is where smart money has sold at high prices, creating bearish pressure that
                        pushes the price down.</li>
                    <li>A demand zone is where smart money has bought at low prices, creating bullish pressure that
                        pushes the price up.</li>

                    <li>If prices revisit these supply and demand zones, they are likely to be rejected.</li>
                    <li>To determine optimal zones, look for sharp price increases or decreases, known as market
                        imbalances, significant price shifts in one direction, indicating smart money involvement.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>To Identify Demand Zones</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Look for fast impulse moves, focusing on big green candles.</li>
                    <li>Locate the base of the zone: place a line at the high of the most recent red candle before the
                        impulse move, and another at the most recent swing low.</li>
                </ol>
                <h3>To Identify Supply Zones</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Look for fast impulse moves with big red candles.</li>
                    <li>Locate the base: find the most recent up candle before the drop, place a line at its low, and
                        another at the most recent swing high.</li>
                </ol>

                    <h3>Follow 2 Rules to Identify Right Zones</h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Trade only fresh and untouched zones because supply and demand zones are one-time use. Once
                            price hits and reverses, the zone loses its
                            power and the probability of causing another reversal in the
                            future is over.</li>
                        <li>Recent zones are more important than older ones; newly created areas are more effective.

                    <li>Market is a battle between buyers and sellers, and the direction of the market is determined by
                        the side with the greatest effort, represented by the volume.</li>

                    <li>Volume is very important because it provides insight into market sentiment and future price
                        movements. It’s easier to understand once you grasp supply and demand principles.</li>
                    <li>This requires relating volume to price action.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>If you want to identify the signs of market manipulation and follow smart money footsteps, you
                        need to learn VSA.</li>
                    <li>Volume indicates how many buyers and sellers are supporting the move. Price movement is stronger
                        when supported by high volume.</li>
                    <li>VSA (Volume Spread Analysis) allows you to identify signs of manipulation and follow smart money
                        footsteps.</li>
                    <li>VSA can reveal when smart money is accumulating or distributing, testing supply or demand, or
                        preparing to start/reverse a trend.</li>
                    <li>VSA is based on the premise that volume is the fuel driving price movements.</li>
                    <li>Volume is the amount of trading activity during a period, while Spread (Range) represents the
                        difference between open and close prices of a candlestick.</li>
                    <li>Analyzing the relationship between volume and spread reveals supply and demand dynamics in the
                        market.</li>
                    <li>When volume and spread are in harmony, buyers and sellers are balanced, and the market tends to
                        continue in the current direction.</li>
                    <li>When volume and spread are in disharmony, there’s an imbalance — the market may reverse or
                        consolidate.</li>
                    <li>When price and volume move together, it indicates strong continuation. For example, an uptrend
                        with increasing volume signals strength.</li>
                    <li>Divergence between price and volume suggests disagreement — the move may not be sustainable. For
                        example, if volume decreases during an uptrend, continuation is unlikely.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>The differences between supply and demand are not random; they come after periods of
                        preparation, as a result of specific events. For the market to develop an effect (trend), first
                        there must be a cause (namely, accumulation/distribution).</li>
                    <li>Every price move has a cause. Changes cannot happen out of nowhere; a cause must be established
                        first.</li>
                    <li>The cause develops during periods of sideways movement or when the market is ranging (look for

                    <li>The longer this process continues, the larger the expected resulting move.</li>

                <h2>Module 7: Liquidity Clear-Outs</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Liquidity:</strong> Liquidity plays a crucial role in a market’s functionality. An ample
                        participation from buyers and sellers is necessary for a market to be considered rich in
                        liquidity. This is why market makers and smart money often engage in liquidity hunting or
                        liquidity clear-outs, which involves extracting liquidity from the market by flushing out weak
                        players.</li>

                    <img src="img/m_7_1.png" alt="Liquidity Clear-Outs"
                        style="max-width:90%; border:2px solid #ccc; border-radius:10px;">
                    <li>The goal of this strategy is to take advantage of the liquidity that is provided by the
                        stop-loss orders of other traders.</li>
                    <li>Liquidity hunting works by identifying areas of high concentration of stop-loss orders in the
                        market. These areas are usually near support and resistance levels, where many traders place
                        their stops to protect their positions.</li>
                    <li>Smart money, or the Composite Man, will then push the price towards these levels, triggering the
                        stop-loss orders and creating a spike in volume and volatility. This spike can also cause other
                        traders to panic and join the move, creating a double trap.</li>
                    <li>Once the liquidity hunters have filled their orders at favorable prices, they will quickly
                        reverse their positions and drive the price back to its original range.</li>
                    <li>This can leave many traders with losses or missed opportunities, while the Composite Man profits
                        from the price swing. This is one of the main strategies used by smart money to make money.</li>
                    <li>Liquidity is the third component in the smart money trading plan.</li>

                        like a smart trader:</li>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Imagine you don’t have a 5000 dollars account, you have a 1 billion dollar account!</li>
                        <li>You have the power to influence price movements and develop trends on the market.</li>
                        <li>You have access to more information, more resources, and more capital than 99% of retail
                            traders, and you need to use various tactics to deceive and manipulate other traders to your
                            advantage.</li>
                        <li>How would you do it?</li>
                        <li>You wouldn’t trade like most retail traders. You’re in the business of making money, so you
                            need many tactics to create false signals, traps, and illusions in the market.</li>
                        <li>Smart money are not necessarily smarter than retail traders. They are simply more

                            <li>They do not trade based on predictions, opinions, or hopes. They trade based on
                                probabilities, facts, and evidence.</li>
                            <li>Smart money does not care about being right or wrong. They care about making money.</li>

                <h2>Module 9: Tactics Used by Smart Money to Trap You</h2>
                <h3>A Game of Psychology and Deception</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Smart money know that most retail traders are driven by fear and greed, and they use these
                        emotions against them.</li>
                    <li>They use various tactics to create false signals, traps, and illusions in the market that lure
                        retail traders into making bad trades or missing out on good ones.</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Tactic No. 1 – Stop Hunting</h4>
                <p>Smart money pushes the price to a level where they know many retail traders have placed their stop
                    losses or take profits. This triggers a cascade of orders that either liquidates their positions or
                    fills their orders at unfavorable prices. This allows smart money to either exit their positions
                    with a profit or enter new positions at a better price.</p>
                <h4>Tactic No. 2 – Fakeouts</h4>
                <p>Smart money creates a false breakout of a support or resistance level that attracts many retail
                    traders to enter in the direction of the breakout. However, after a few candles, the price reverses
                    sharply in the opposite direction, trapping those traders in losing trades.</p>
                <h4>Tactic No. 3 – Whipsaws</h4>
                <p>Smart money creates a lot of volatility and noise in the market that confuses many retail traders.
                    The price moves up and down rapidly without any clear direction or trend, causing many traders to
                    exit their trades prematurely or switch sides frequently.</p>
                <div class="note">
                    <strong>Note:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The reality is that many retail traders will use the same price levels to place their
                            entries or stop losses. These are the perfect zones for smart money to trigger one of their
                            traps!</li>
                        <li><strong>Why is this difference between retail traders and smart money?</strong>
                            <br>
                            Because smart money doesn’t trade like retail traders who rely on technical analysis,
                            indicators,
                            or chart patterns. Institutional players cannot trade the same way because in low
                            liquidity
                            areas, their large orders would push price too far. Smart money uses high liquidity
                            zones to
                            place their large orders without excessively impacting the price.

                </ul>
                <p>Smart money uses these fake breakouts for two main reasons:</p>

                        style="max-width:90%; border:2px solid #ccc; border-radius:10px;">
                    <li>Smart money may push the price above the high of the day to trigger stop losses and buy orders
                        from retail traders, trapping those who are following the breakout. This creates a surge in
                        demand that drives the price higher.</li>
                    <img src="img/m_10a_4.png" alt="Fake Breakout at the High/Low of the Day"
                        style="max-width:90%; border:2px solid #ccc; border-radius:10px;">
                    <li>But you can identify this by analyzing the volume and looking for common price action patterns.
                        Fake breakouts often form specific price action patterns that signal a reversal or continuation
                        of the trend. For example:</li>
                </ul>
                <ol>
                    <li>Double top at the high of the day, after a fake breakout</li>
                    <li>Double bottom at the low of the day, after a fake breakout</li>
                    <li>Look for reversal candlestick patterns that indicate bullish or bearish sentiment in the market.
                        For example – pin bars or candles with large wicks are a clear sign of rejection after a failed
                        breakout.</li>

                <h2>Module 10: Smart Money Traps - Asian Session Trap</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>The Asian trading session is one of the main zones targeted by the smart money – characterized
                        by low volatility and tight trading ranges.</li>
                    <li>The Tokyo range trap is a common phenomenon, especially in Forex, Crypto, and Indices markets.
                        It occurs during the Asian session, typically characterized by low volatility and tight ranges.
                    </li>
                    <li>The Tokyo range trap refers to situations where smart money uses the session range to trap
                        retail traders into false breakouts and reversals, then exploits their positions during the more
                        volatile and liquid London and New York sessions.</li>
                    <li>One common tactic is creating a false breakout of the Tokyo range – the high and low of the
                        price action during the Tokyo session.</li>
                    <li>Price moves beyond the range, then quickly reverses back inside, creating a false signal for
                        retail traders who enter or exit based on the breakout, only to find himself
                        trapped in losing positions when the price moves against him. </li>
                    <li>Another tactic is the false reversal of the Tokyo range, the opposite of a false breakout.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>How to Avoid the Tokyo Range Trap</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Use volume to measure the strength of the breakout.</li>
                    <li>High volume outside the Tokyo range indicates strong market participation and conviction behind
                        a price
                        movement. </li>
                    <li>Low volume outside the Tokyo range shows weak participation and low conviction behind a price
                        movement.</li>
                    <li>A high-volume breakout or reversal is more likely to be genuine than a low-volume one.</li>
                    <li>Study past examples of how the Tokyo range trap has affected market trends.</li>
                    <li><strong>Analyze past Tokyo sessions to find patterns:</strong> In this example, traders who have
                        taken short
                        positions at the top of the Asian range had their stop losses hunted, outside of the range. Each
                        time, the
                        market reversed aggressively in the opposite direction. The upward movement outside of the range
                        also
                        seduced traders to take long positions, hoping for breakout trade and that’s the second batch of
                        traders,
                        who were trapped i.e., long breakout traders were also trapped!</li>

                <h2>Module 10: Smart Money Traps – Wedges/Triangles Trap</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Wedges & Triangles are two of the most common chart patterns that traders use to identify
                        potential reversals or continuations in the market. But be careful, not all wedges and triangles
                        are genuine!</li>
                    <li>Sometimes, they are deliberately created by smart money to trap retail traders.</li>
                    <li>Wedges and Triangles are usually formed by two converging trend lines that connect the highs and
                        lows of price action. They indicate a period of consolidation, where the market is indecisive
                        and the trading range narrows.</li>
                    <li><strong>Point to be noted:</strong> Smart money knows that many traders rely on wedges and
                        triangles to make trading decisions. They can use these patterns to create false signals and
                        lure unsuspecting traders into traps.</li>
                    <li>You’ll often see that price breaks out of a wedge or a triangle in one direction but then
                        quickly reverses and moves in the opposite direction – this creates confusion and panic among
                        traders who followed the initial breakout signal and entered positions in that direction.</li>
                    <li>The idea is to trap traders on the wrong side of the market. For example, this will result in a
                        sharp decline in price and a minor reversal of the uptrend.</li>

                    <li>Smart money can create a symmetrical triangle or wedge pattern in a sideways market and induce
                        stop runs on both sides of the triangle. This causes traders who entered positions based on
                        either side of the breakout to exit their trades at a loss.</li>
                    <li>Smart money will take advantage of this liquidity and enter positions in their desired
                        direction.</li>
                    <img src="img/m_10c_3.png" alt="Wedges/Triangles Trap"
                        style="max-width:90%; border:2px solid #ccc; border-radius:10px;">
                    <li>The reality is that it’s very hard to know for sure whether a wedge or a triangle pattern is
                        genuine or fake.</li>
                    <li>In such cases, there is no way of predicting which direction the price will ultimately break
                        out. Avoid trading during this type of consolidation.</li>

                <h2>Module 10: Smart Money Traps – Market Open Manipulation</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Market open manipulation is another trap which refers to the deliberate actions of smart money
                        to create false impressions of supply and demand in the market.</li>
                    <li>These actions are designed to influence price movements and the psychology of retail traders,
                        who often trade based on technical analysis, indicators, or news. It’s the reality that every
                        trader has to face and deal with.</li>
                    <li>The market open manipulation happens for two main reasons: smart money wants to take profit from
                        their existing positions or to accumulate or distribute more positions at favorable prices.</li>
                    <li>For example: this will trigger stop-loss orders and panic selling from retail traders.</li>

                    <img src="img/m_10d_1.png" alt="Market Open Manipulation"
                        style="max-width:90%; border:2px solid #ccc; border-radius:10px;">
                </ul>
                <p><strong>There are many types of market manipulation that smart money can use to trick retail traders.
                        By now,
                        you already know them:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Fake Breakouts:</strong> Smart money pushes the price above or below a significant
                        support or resistance level, only to reverse it shortly after. This creates a false signal that
                        the market is trending in one direction when in fact it’s going in the opposite direction.</li>
                    <li><strong>Stop-Loss Hunting:</strong> Smart money targets the areas where retail traders place
                        their stop-loss orders, such as below support levels or above resistance levels.</li>
                    <li><strong>False Signals:</strong> Smart money uses indicators, news events, or other factors to
                        generate misleading signals that contradict the actual market direction. For example, smart
                        money may release positive news about a stock before the market opens, causing retail traders to
                        buy into the hype. Or they deliberately move the price above a common moving average, enticing
                        moving average traders to enter. Once the market opens, smart money sells their positions at
                        high prices and then drives the price down.</li>

                    <img src="img/m_10d_2.png" alt="Market Open Manipulation"
                        style="max-width:90%; border:2px solid #ccc; border-radius:10px;">
                </ul>
                <ul>
                    <li>Market open manipulation can reduce liquidity in the market by creating artificial supply and
                        demand imbalances. This can make it harder for retail traders to enter or exit their positions
                        at favorable prices.</li>
                    <li>For beginner traders, it’s very hard to make money in these conditions. The market open trap can
                        distort the true direction and strength of market trends, confusing retail traders who rely on
                        trend-following strategies or indicators.</li>

                <h2>Module 10: Smart Money Traps – Accumulation / Distribution Trap</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Trading is a game of psychology and strategy, where smart money traders try to outsmart and
                        outplay retail traders who often lack the knowledge, experience, and discipline to succeed in
                        the market.</li>
                    <li>One of the ways that smart money gains an edge over retail traders is by using accumulation and
                        distribution strategies to manipulate and trap them.</li>

                    <img src="img/m_10e_1.png" alt="Accumulation / Distribution Trap"
                        style="max-width:90%; border:2px solid #ccc; border-radius:10px;">
                    <li>The goal of these strategies is to create false signals and expectations in the market that lure
                        retail traders into buying or selling at the wrong time.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>During Accumulation:</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Smart money traders may create a downtrend or a consolidation pattern, making it appear that the
                        market is weak or bearish. This may induce retail traders to sell their positions or short the
                        market, expecting further price declines.</li>
                    <li>Smart money will suddenly reverse the trend and push the price up, triggering stop losses of
                        retail traders with short positions. This creates a bullish breakout that attracts more buyers
                        into the market, allowing smart money traders to distribute their positions at high prices.</li>
                </ol>
                <h3>During Distribution:</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Smart money may create an uptrend or a consolidation pattern, making it appear that the market
                        is strong and bullish. This may induce retail traders to go long, expecting further price
                        increases.</li>
                    <li>Once smart money has distributed enough positions at high prices, they may suddenly reverse the
                        trend and push the price down, triggering stop losses of retail traders who went long. This
                        creates a bearish breakdown that attracts more sellers into the market, allowing smart money
                        traders to accumulate more positions at low prices.</li>
                </ol>
                <ul>
                    <li>Smart money traders often use volume to confirm or conceal their accumulation and distribution
                        strategies.</li>
                    <li>During the accumulation phase, smart money traders may use low volume to hide their buying
                        activity and create a false sense of weakness in the market.</li>
                    <li>However, if you analyze price action during this phase, you’ll see higher lows at the bottom of
                        the accumulation, which is a bullish signal.</li>
                    <li>Smart money traders will use support and resistance to test and break the confidence and
                        conviction of retail traders by creating false breakouts that trap them on the wrong side of the
                        market.</li>
                    <li>During the accumulation phase, known as “The Spring,” smart money traders will usually use the
                        support level to create false breakdowns that make retail traders think the price will fall
                        further below support.</li>

                <h2>Module 11: How to Align with Smart Money</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Trading will always be a game between the smart money against the dumb money.</li>
                    <li>Retail traders might see some patterns as continuation ones, but the smart money are seeing them
                        as reversal patterns!</li>
                    <li>You’ve seen the different traps used by big players. In order to align yourself with their true
                        intentions, always remember that smart money is always searching for pockets of liquidity in
                        order to fill their desired positions in the market!</li>
                    <li>They are always looking to shake out weak hands, particularly around support and resistance
                        levels that are being widely watched.</li>
                    <li><strong>Your New Trading Plan:</strong> Reconsider how you trade and start building a strategy
                        that allows you to join the smart money after a liquidity clear-out or after an obvious market
                        trap.</li>
                    <li>Big players need lots of liquidity in order to fill their massive orders.</li>
                    <li><strong>How do they get this liquidity?</strong> By creating well-known retail chart patterns
                        and traps in order
                        to involve retail traders into the market.</li>

                    <li>For retail traders like you and me, the aim should be to spot potential liquidity zones and join
                        the game of the
                        market makers, avoiding being a liquidity target.</li>
                    <li>The simplest structure to pay attention to are zones with equal highs or lows. Always assume
                        smart money will want to trap traders around these areas!</li>
                    <li>A liquidity clear-out should always present itself with a rapid, strong reversal move after a
                        critical area is taken out – a rapid rotation of price back into the previous trading range.

                        <li>Identify a liquidity run that breaks below a previous swing low or support level where many
                            retail traders have placed their stop-loss orders.</li>
                        <li>Identify a potential demand zone that was previously formed near the liquidity run.</li>
                        <li>Wait for price to retest the demand zone and confirm its validity by finding signs of
                            rejection or bounce (wicks, VSA confirmation).</li>

                    <p>A break of structure doesn't always result in reversal! Align your positions with smart money

                    <p><strong>Trading Plan:</strong> Find a break of structure pattern, wait for a retracement, and
                        find a supply and demand zone for an entry to execute the trade with higher accuracy.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Break of structure: Lower Low - Lower High - Lower Low - Higher High</li>
                        <li>Find the fresh demand zone (rally base rally) - look for the last bearish candle before the

                            market sentiment and behavior – round numbers or multiples like 50, 100, etc.</li>
                        <li>These numbers tend to act as support and resistance levels, as well as trigger points for
                            stop-losses and take-profits, reflecting the collective psychology of market participants.
                        </li>
                        <li>You will often see increased volatility, increased volume, and many liquidity clear-outs
                            around these levels.</li>
                        <li><strong>Sell Zone:</strong> Supply Zone + Psychological Level</li>
